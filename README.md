## Week 2 Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: **Samara Augustin**

### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [X] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [X] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [X] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [X] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product.

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [X] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics that were discussed in the labs prepared me to complete the assignment. In order to complete the assignment, I needed to have knowledge of CSS, HTML, Javascript, React, Express, and front-end and back-end programming. Throughout the week and last week, we learned and practiced these topics which allowed me to implement several of the requirements for this assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time to work on this project, I would have attempted more of the stretch features and improved the overall styling of the assignment. Some of the features I would have liked to implement are creating a navigation bar and adding functionality to the add and remove buttons, which would simulate a shopping cart.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

During my project demo, I believe that I presented all of my features clearly and answered questions coherently. I noticed that my peer created a navigation bar for the search engine and I found it to be an amazing feature therefore I would want to implement it into my website.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

I would like to give a shoutout to my instructors/TAs and peers who have assisted me whenever I needed help.
